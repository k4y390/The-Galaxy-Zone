      Here, you can get to learn and know about the many different galaxies
      that are located all throughout the universe. You are currently on the home
      page where you will find the largest spiral and elliptical galaxies and irregular
      galaxy of the year as well as some links to videos. Feel free to surf the website 
      and explore all the areas that the universe has to offer.

        <p>
          Messier 87 or M87 is known as an elliptical galaxy and has a distance of 53 million light-years from Earth,
          a radius of 60,000 light-years and a diameter of 120,000 light-years. It is also 13.24 billion years old.
          The galaxy was first discovered by Charles Messier (the person in which the galaxy got it's name from)
          in 1781. It also has a radial velocity of 1,256 km/s.

          IC 3583
        </h2>
        <p>
          IC 3583 is known as an irregular galaxy and has a distance of 30 million light-years from Earth. 
          It also has an apparent magnitude/luminosity of 13.3. It was first discovered by Issac 
          Roberts on April 29, 1892. To this day, little of the cause of it's structure is known. It has
          been said that the galaxy had been interacting in a gravitational sense with Messier 90, one 
          of the spiral galaxies.
