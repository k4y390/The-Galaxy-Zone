    The Andromeda Galaxy
    </h1>
  <h2>
    Origin
  </h2>
    <p>
      In 965 CE, Islamic-Persian astronomer al-Sūfi mentions the galaxy in the Book of the Fixed Stars. Although in 1612, German 
      astronomer Simon Marius had rediscovered what he says resembles a candle light seen through a horn. It must have formed from two 
      galaxies being involved in an orbit 7 to 10 billion years ago. The galaxies later merged to become the Andromeda Galaxy. 
      The merging occurred from 1.8 to 3 billion years ago.
