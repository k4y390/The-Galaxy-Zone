    The Comet Galaxy
    </h1>
  <h2>
    Origin
  </h2>
    <p>
      On March 2, 2007, a research team was taking a look at some galaxy clusters with the Hubble telescope. Those galaxy clusters 
      turned out to be part of the Comet Galaxy. It was said that the gravity of galaxy clusters are causing the galaxy to constantly 
      be torn apart into the form of a comet in which this is how the galaxy got its name. At the same time, the speed of which the 
      galaxy is moving and the forces of gravity in which the galaxy is being torn apart by others while in motion can help consider 
      the fact that this was how the galaxy was formed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Characteristics and Features
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Comet Galaxy has a diameter of 600,000 light-years, a radius of 300,000 light-years and a distance of 3.2 billion light-years from Earth. 
      It also includes blue knots and slightly bright and thin stars. According to study collaborator Jean-Paul Kneib of the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique 
      de Marseille, it has been said that a process known as the ram pressure stripping process and tidal forces have been tearing them apart as well.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Interesting Facts
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is known as a spiral galaxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is located within the constellations Sculptor and Sextans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the fastest galaxies that travels through space by having a speed of 3.22 million kilometers per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been a part of an observation along with other galaxies that are a part of Abell 2667 that helped to consider that many galaxies in general are low in gas.
